Abstract

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly transmissible acute respiratory disease that is caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), a beta coronavirus first discovered in Wuhan, China, in late 2019. COVID-19 has been spreading swiftly globally, and as of March 2020, has been officially declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). One of the challenges in managing COVID-19 is the identification of a swift, accessible, and reliable diagnostic modality that could serve as an alternative to a reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RT-PCR is still the recommended tool in diagnosing COVID-19, but the notion of a more prompt and accurate diagnostic tool is a possibility worth looking into. The objective of this case study is to investigate the importance and utility of chest computed tomography (CT) in the diagnosis of COVID-19, as increasing pieces of evidence suggest that chest CT could prove useful in the clinical pathway in diagnosing COVID-19.
Keywords: CNN (Convolutional Neural Network), CT (computed tomography), RT-PCR (reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction).

1. Overview

The Project AI based COVID-19 detection using images of CT Scan of Chest uses a deep learning algorithms such as CNN (Convolutional Neural Network archictecture) in which a deep learning model is prepared by training a CNN model with CT Scan image dataset implemented using keras library and tensorflow as a backened and futher deployed using flask web service. It will take image as a input and return a result whether there is high risk of infection or low risk of infection.

2.Functional Requirements

4.Observation

•	Activation function Sigmoid is giving more better accuracy than softmax activation function.
•	So overall model accuracy is 84% it can increased by increasing the amount of dataset or improving the quality of dataset.
  Sensitivity: 1.0    
  Specificity: 0.9
  Accuracy:84%
